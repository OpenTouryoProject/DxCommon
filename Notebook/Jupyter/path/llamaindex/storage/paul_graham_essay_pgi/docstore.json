school, were writing and programming. I didn't write essays. I wrote what beginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still are: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot, just characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them deep.\r\n\r\nThe first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our school district used for what was then called \"data processing.\" This was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district's 1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and my friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like a mini Bond villain's lair down there, with all these alien-looking machines \u2014 CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader \u2014 sitting up on a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.\r\n\r\nThe language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to type programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader and press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The result would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly loud printer.\r\n\r\nI was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn't figure out what to do with it. And in retrospect there's not much I could have done with it. The only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards, and I didn't have any data stored on punched cards. The only other option was to do things that didn't rely on any input, like calculate approximations of pi, but I didn't know enough math to do anything interesting of that type. So I'm not surprised I can't remember any programs I wrote, because they can't have done much. My clearest memory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not to terminate, when one of mine didn't. On a machine without time-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as the data center manager's expression made clear.\r\n\r\nWith microcomputers, everything changed.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 6, "end_char_idx": 1999, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9979f9aa-4d81-47d4-a100-dd6c3d321808": {"__data__": {"id_": "9979f9aa-4d81-47d4-a100-dd6c3d321808", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/mnt/d/git/Dev/OpenTouryoProject/DX/DxCommon/Notebook/Jupyter/path/llamaindex/data/paul_graham_essay/paul_graham_essay.txt", "file_name": "paul_graham_essay.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75400, "creation_date": "2024-12-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7f5ea84f-d772-4414-9b6e-dd32ecf1461d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/mnt/d/git/Dev/OpenTouryoProject/DX/DxCommon/Notebook/Jupyter/path/llamaindex/data/paul_graham_essay/paul_graham_essay.txt", "file_name": "paul_graham_essay.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75400, "creation_date": "2024-12-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-28"}, "hash": "8d19d12e07681f467c66a7a70d528aa40c2efc47f73b37f5b3acc3591e6878d6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f3fe01f7-4644-4eda-b854-2d882086dbc7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/mnt/d/git/Dev/OpenTouryoProject/DX/DxCommon/Notebook/Jupyter/path/llamaindex/data/paul_graham_essay/paul_graham_essay.txt", "file_name": "paul_graham_essay.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75400, "creation_date": "2024-12-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-28"}, "hash": "cb1e61dd861910ff9af7455d66cdc6c243788f8ec81978b28777005f290c2856", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6de1da6c-1036-4efd-95f6-0c0c4a94b229", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "dedeb6c243e6b8f5cd364b62a9baa062e0a44a6a93bbba0924193862b3ccae9d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "I was puzzled by the 1401.

It seemed, to my naive high school self, to be the study of the ultimate truths, compared to which the things studied in other fields would be mere domain knowledge.

I haven't tried rereading The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, so I don't know how well it has aged, but when I read it I was drawn entirely into its world. It seemed only a matter of time before we'd have Mike, and when I saw Winograd using SHRDLU, it seemed like that time would be a few years at most. All you had to do was teach SHRDLU more words.\r\n\r\nThere weren't any classes in AI at Cornell then, not even graduate classes, so I started trying to teach myself. Which meant learning Lisp, since in those days Lisp was regarded as the language of AI. The commonly used programming languages then were pretty primitive, and programmers' ideas correspondingly so. The default language at Cornell was a Pascal-like language called PL/I, and the situation was similar elsewhere. Learning Lisp expanded my concept of a program so fast that it was years before I started to have a sense of where the new limits were.

Grad students could take classes in any department, and my advisor, Tom Cheatham, was very easy going. If he even knew about the strange classes I was taking, he never said anything.\r\n\r\nSo now I was in a PhD program in computer science, yet planning to be an artist, yet also genuinely in love with Lisp hacking and working away at On Lisp. In other words, like many a grad student, I was working energetically on multiple projects that were not my thesis.\r\n\r\nI didn't see a way out of this situation.

These paintings were tiny, because the room was, and because I painted them on leftover scraps of canvas, which was all I could afford at the time. Painting still lives is different from painting people, because the subject, as its name suggests, can't move. People can't sit for more than about 15 minutes at a time, and when they do they don't sit very still. So the traditional m.o. for painting people is to know how to paint a generic person, which you then modify to match the specific person you're painting. Whereas a still life you can, if you want, copy pixel by pixel from what you're seeing. You don't want to stop there, of course, or you get merely photographic accuracy, and what makes a still life interesting is that it's been through a head. You want to emphasize the visual cues that tell you, for example, that the reason the color changes suddenly at a certain point is that it's the edge of an object. By subtly emphasizing such things you can make paintings that are more realistic than photographs not just in some metaphorical sense, but in the strict information-theoretic sense.

[4]\r\n\r\nI liked painting still lives because I was curious about what I was seeing. In everyday life, we aren't consciously aware of much we're seeing. Most visual perception is handled by low-level processes that merely tell your brain \"that's a water droplet\" without telling you details like where the lightest and darkest points are, or \"that's a bush\" without telling you the shape and position of every leaf. This is a feature of brains, not a bug. In everyday life it would be distracting to notice every leaf on every bush. But when you have to paint something, you have to look more closely, and when you do there's a lot to see. You can still be noticing new things after days of trying to paint something people usually take for granted, just as you can after days of trying to write an essay about something people usually take for granted.\r\n\r\nThis is not the only way to paint.

Better organized, certainly, and a lot more expensive, but it was now becoming clear that art school did not bear the same relationship to art that medical school bore to medicine.

[6]\r\n\r\nThere were plenty of earnest students too: kids who \"could draw\" in high school, and now had come to what was supposed to be the best art school in the country, to learn to draw even better. They tended to be confused and demoralized by what they found at RISD, but they kept going, because painting was what they did. I was not one of the kids who could draw in high school, but at RISD I was definitely closer to their tribe than the tribe of signature style seekers.\r\n\r\nI learned a lot in the color class I took at RISD, but otherwise I was basically teaching myself to paint, and I could do that for free. So in 1993 I dropped out. I hung around Providence for a bit, and then my college friend Nancy Parmet did me a big favor.

I had visions of a whole new generation of software working this way. You wouldn't need versions, or ports, or any of that crap.

Maybe one day we'd have so many users that I couldn't scan their images for them, but in the meantime there was nothing more important to do.\r\n\r\nAnother thing I didn't get at the time is that growth rate is the ultimate test of a startup. Our growth rate was fine. We had about 70 stores at the end of 1996 and about 500 at the end of 1997. I mistakenly thought the thing that mattered was the absolute number of users. And that is the thing that matters in the sense that that's how much money you're making, and if you're not making enough, you might go out of business.

Now when I walked past charming little restaurants I could go in and order lunch. It was exciting for a while. Painting started to go better. I experimented with a new kind of still life where I'd paint one painting in the old way, then photograph it and print it, blown up, on canvas, and then use that as the underpainting for a second still life, painted from the same objects (which hopefully hadn't rotted yet).\r\n\r\nMeanwhile I looked for an apartment to buy. Now I could actually choose what neighborhood to live in. Where, I asked myself and various real estate agents, is the Cambridge of New York? Aided by occasional visits to actual Cambridge, I gradually realized there wasn't one. Huh.\r\n\r\nAround this time, in the spring of 2000, I had an idea. It was clear from our experience with Viaweb that web apps were the future. Why not build a web app for making web apps?

I hoped to lure Robert into working on it with me, but there I ran into a hitch. Robert was now a postdoc at MIT, and though he'd made a lot of money the last time I'd lured him into working on one of my schemes, it had also been a huge time sink.

From then on I knew that whatever else I did, I'd always write essays too.\r\n\r\nI knew that online essays would be a marginal medium at first. Socially they'd seem more like rants posted by nutjobs on their GeoCities sites than the genteel and beautifully typeset compositions published in The New Yorker. But by this point I knew enough to find that encouraging instead of discouraging.\r\n\r\nOne of the most conspicuous patterns I've noticed in my life is how well it has worked, for me at least, to work on things that weren't prestigious. Still life has always been the least prestigious form of painting. Viaweb and Y Combinator both seemed lame when we started them. I still get the glassy eye from strangers when they ask what I'm writing, and I explain that it's an essay I'm going to publish on my web site. Even Lisp, though prestigious intellectually in something like the way Latin is, also seems about as hip.\r\n\r\nIt's not that unprestigious types of work are good per se.

It was cheap enough to run that we funded it with our own money. That went right by 99% of readers, but professional investors are thinking \"Wow, that means they got all the returns.\" But once again, this was not due to any particular insight on our part. We didn't know how VC firms were organized. It never occurred to us to try to raise a fund, and if it had, we wouldn't have known where to start. [14]\r\n\r\nThe most distinctive thing about YC is the batch model: to fund a bunch of startups all at once, twice a year, and then to spend three months focusing intensively on trying to help them.

But while I continued to work a good deal in Arc, I gradually stopped working on Arc, partly because I didn't have time to, and partly because it was a lot less attractive to mess around with the language now that we had all this infrastructure depending on it. So now my three projects were reduced to two: writing essays and working on YC.\r\n\r\nYC was different from other kinds of work I've done. Instead of deciding for myself what to work on, the problems came to me. Every 6 months there was a new batch of startups, and their problems, whatever they were, became our problems. It was very engaging work, because their problems were quite varied, and the good founders were very effective.

I even wrote a couple that weren't about startups. Then in March 2015 I started working on Lisp again.\r\n\r\nThe distinctive thing about Lisp is that its core is a language defined by writing an interpreter in itself. It wasn't originally intended as a programming language in the ordinary sense. It was meant to be a formal model of computation, an alternative to the Turing machine. If you want to write an interpreter for a language in itself, what's the minimum set of predefined operators you need? The Lisp that John McCarthy invented, or more accurately discovered, is an answer to that question. [19]\r\n\r\nMcCarthy didn't realize this Lisp could even be used to program computers till his grad student Steve Russell suggested it. Russell translated McCarthy's interpreter into IBM 704 machine language, and from that point Lisp started also to be a programming language in the ordinary sense. But its origins as a model of computation gave it a power and elegance that other languages couldn't match.

[19]\r\n\r\nMcCarthy didn't realize this Lisp could even be used to program computers till his grad student Steve Russell suggested it. Russell translated McCarthy's interpreter into IBM 704 machine language, and from that point Lisp started also to be a programming language in the ordinary sense. But its origins as a model of computation gave it a power and elegance that other languages couldn't match.

It was missing a lot of things you'd want in a programming language. So these had to be added, and when they were, they weren't defined using McCarthy's original axiomatic approach. That wouldn't have been feasible at the time. McCarthy tested his interpreter by hand-simulating the execution of programs. But it was already getting close to the limit of interpreters you could test that way \u2014 indeed, there was a bug in it that McCarthy had overlooked. To test a more complicated interpreter, you'd have had to run it, and computers then weren't powerful enough.\r\n\r\nNow they are, though. Now you could continue using McCarthy's axiomatic approach till you'd defined a complete programming language. And as long as every change you made to McCarthy's Lisp was a discoveredness-preserving transformation, you could, in principle, end up with a complete language that had this quality.

Any sufficiently advanced alien civilization would certainly know about the Pythagorean theorem, for example. I believe, though with less certainty, that they would also know about the Lisp in McCarthy's 1960 paper.\r\n\r\nBut if so there's no reason to suppose that this is the limit of the language that might be known to them. Presumably aliens need numbers and errors and I/O too. So it seems likely there exists at least one path out of McCarthy's Lisp along which discoveredness is preserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks to Trevor Blackwell, John Collison, Patrick Collison, Daniel Gackle, Ralph Hazell, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, and Harj Taggar for reading drafts of this.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 73661, "end_char_idx": 75367, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"7f5ea84f-d772-4414-9b6e-dd32ecf1461d": {"node_ids": ["f3fe01f7-4644-4eda-b854-2d882086dbc7", "9979f9aa-4d81-47d4-a100-dd6c3d321808", "6de1da6c-1036-4efd-95f6-0c0c4a94b229", "9795131f-2d7b-4b0c-a7a5-97a65d0a6208", "914c3788-825a-4b40-b926-b98705112119", "92c78d0e-c2ac-4f1e-88dd-d9dae035d95e", "e411d86d-148a-4c35-9356-4d81063dc2f5", "4c80cea5-c9fe-4401-9b6b-1fd0b6c6fe63", "0e9c4e85-0daa-4322-b42a-ce09a06749ae", "a5bc0ef2-b468-4ee6-a86b-6663402dd873", "c1702758-9471-4d6a-9058-afca0cbde743", "bea80de3-af34-4e04-bf8e-d293ad04c5aa", "03573060-8036-4839-8434-0f2a8cd099c6", "ef2108d1-b899-461e-8352-373f367ef05c", "76518568-419f-4fd6-ae49-bf0ad1785463", "734ec72c-7abf-44b0-b6d6-e6be88ce14be", "56653b53-473e-4e06-b7f0-ee09c3e2c1c9", "d28ec6cb-7e1c-407b-9ad0-609e521abf43", "6a859a62-3fd9-42c2-83cf-66d0ce1c444f", "1b904281-fe8c-4a5f-abd9-6436c1f97f1e", "596cf0dc-f342-406f-9690-ec184680a210", "e7150ba8-2ae9-4fcd-94ca-61fba3e43538", "37477139-b7d8-4c5f-96d7-10f54c6a88d7", "67a1506f-e869-455b-a997-4d2d8741d95a", "3ddd7f3f-9872-4fd5-be51-ed7fdebee42a", "6aaa3304-62a9-42f2-bc9a-5c7b55dbeba5", "a76326a2-96e7-43a2-8ffa-51b871a697eb", "01572c50-768c-4021-a19c-3230c8ea902a", "a928ebf4-c398-4ce1-abf1-0d80e9f5e9aa", "cce00b8c-a45b-4b0f-8499-cc8dc3e13666", "777c3786-f479-4115-92b5-1d96d255973f", "0352cf06-6de4-4abe-93cc-3de4a20c59d3", "9c535711-178b-4dce-aa63-8bf1ed436a0d", "351cb5d9-2704-428a-bd72-bd57ca8d5f82", "ca0f1b8c-c576-4ec8-9670-76bb5b020095", "2493bc01-2874-4893-82bf-a69c1739b844", "b4f4c09b-b214-4bc2-a3c0-dc24f0e5bf0f", "087be79c-696d-4d33-a2de-9ef0549cc4e3", "4d883f54-ecb8-4741-a521-00832fc0be18", "75bf283a-ec20-4558-a263-17f75c0b2034", "d9124841-59a3-408c-bdb8-a76f5a261b25", "2236df48-3c01-4603-aae9-b25c473e1acb", "92452bce-4229-4cf1-999b-d86374c1f557", "81e7cb83-376a-4f7e-9b74-cc2ad3bcd11a", "5fdfc5e6-b47f-49ee-add7-290c1805b1d4", "c1409b39-7988-4522-8354-50c00f772e20", "eef64fe0-f19e-4c12-9ab7-6fa5bca7087c", "cff00e09-a9c2-4e58-af54-9e39f5ec9db8", "71e26edb-6353-47b7-89f3-d05a767d959d", "cd2c73d7-71f3-468c-a1f1-e9ddda400f3c", "104c6bdb-ecab-4f7c-a0ac-5df6ef43007e", "ed2d9e8f-d9a2-4fe3-9236-39e6710d1dd0", "090a39b0-5e57-458f-a486-18f3740ea32b", "4fcc11b5-6c49-468e-9c9a-9093e0e947f8", "f2beff9d-b558-44d6-916c-f9128b28b816", "35492f81-d656-4bd7-bf77-4b7572914228", "bae9180c-b8fa-4070-8566-5bcc39284fde", "bb437d3a-e15d-4fab-b7d7-66ed5923407b", "cfa6001e-b91f-423a-9765-42c8e0b01445", "b50fe51f-f320-4124-a29f-f947cceaff09", "cc7a3dc7-9598-479f-aa64-9731c0f7e195", "0d63bf8d-ef05-4baf-99f0-309f20a48057", "9db5da85-97b2-4580-a138-03820820a24b", "4e81686b-7eb7-4582-b49c-264735e63622"], "metadata": {"file_path": "/mnt/d/git/Dev/OpenTouryoProject/DX/DxCommon/Notebook/Jupyter/path/llamaindex/data/paul_graham_essay/paul_graham_essay.txt", "file_name": "paul_graham_essay.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75400, "creation_date": "2024-12-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-28"}}}}
